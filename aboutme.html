    <h1> About Chance Eipperle </h1>
    <H2>My name is Chance EIpperle and I am an aspiring UX/UI Designer from Dubuque, Iowa.</H2>
    <p>Growing up I always had a passion for both technology and finding new ways to solve problems. As soon as I learned about the industrial design program at Iowa State University, I knew that that is what I wanted to do. You could say it is in my blood to become a designer too because I was inspired by my mother and father who are an interior designer and an architect respectively.</p>
    <p>As I went through the industrial design cirriculum I was able to explore a variety of disiplines within industrial design</p>
